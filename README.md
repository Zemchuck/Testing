# Lab 4 - data & models testing

This lab concerns testing data quality, model behavioral testing, and explainability.
Those operations are crucial part of data-centric AI approach, and constitute a large
part of MLOps quality assurance.

2. Model behavioral testing:
   - input perturbations and behavioral testing
   - Giskard 
3. ML explainability:
   - local explainability
   - gradient-based attribution methods
   - Captum
